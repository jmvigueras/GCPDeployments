# Deployment of FortiGate-VM HA on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
## Introduction
A Terraform script to deploy FortiGate-VM HA (A-P) on GCP multi Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

## Requirements
* [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install.html) >= 0.12.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform >=2.11.0
* Terraform Provider for Google Cloud Platform Beta >=2.13
* Terraform Provider for random 2.2.1
* Terraform Provider for template 2.1.2
* A [GCP OAuth2 access token](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2)

## Deployment overview
Terraform deploys the following components:
   - A VPC with one public subnet - port1 FTG
   - A VPC INTERNAL - port2 FTG
   - A VPC SPOKE1 - port4 FTG
   - A VPC SPOKE2 - port5 FTG
   - A VPC MGMT and HA - port 3 FTG for management and ha
   - Two FortiGate-VM (BYOL/PAYG) instances with five NICs
   - Firewall rules for allowing traffic to public interface from internal, spoke1 and spoke2, also between spokes.

## HA failover
SDN connector for GCP is used to update subnets routes and cluster IP.
   - Subnet private-route is update to fortigate IP on that interface
   - Subnet spoke1-route is update to fortigate IP on that interface
   - Subnet spoke2-route is update to fortigate IP on that interface
   - External IP cluster-ip is linked to public interface

## Deployment
To deploy the FortiGate-VM to GCP:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Obtain a GCP OAuth2 token and input it in the vars.tf file.
3. Customize variables in the `vars.tf` file as needed.
4. Initialize the providers and modules:
   ```sh
   $ cd XXXXX
   $ terraform init
    ```
5. Submit the Terraform plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform plan
   ```
6. Verify output.
7. Confirm and apply the plan:
   ```sh
   $ terraform apply
   ```
8. If output is satisfactory, type `yes`.

Output will include the information necessary to log in to the FortiGate-VM instances:
```sh
FortiGate-HA-Cluster-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-HA-Master-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-HA-Slave-MGMT-IP = XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
FortiGate-Password = <password here>
FortiGate-Username = admin
```

## Destroy the instance
To destroy the instance, use the command:
```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
